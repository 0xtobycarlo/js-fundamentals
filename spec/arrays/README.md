# Arrays
Variables allow us to store a single value. An `age` variable is a single number, a `name` variable is a single string. But what if we wanted to have not one, but several names stored for later? Or what if we wanted to store a list of tweets or a list of items in a shopping cart?

**Arrays** allow us to do this. Array's are a single data type used to represent a list of things. For example, the code below creates a list of 3 names:

```javascript
 const names = ['Nicolas', 'Sergio', 'Steven']
```

Look at the examples file to see how you can declare, access and modify arrays then work your way through the remaining tests.
